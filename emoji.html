                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>
                        Emoji are symbols that are illustrated to resemble the physical things they represent. These can be people, animals, vehicles, or even emotions. Because emoji are most often used in electronic communication, typically sent in plain text, they serve to add expressiveness to those messages. At the same time, their meaning and intent depends on the context in which they are used. In the following paragraphs, we'll explore the history of emoji, including how they were standardized, examine their interpretation, discuss whether emoji can be thought of as a language, and consider their future. This will be accomplished through the design decisions framework--what, how or by whom, why, when, and how much--of the various organizing systems that emoji are a part of. Specifically, we'll consider three levels: standardization, implementation, and usage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Originating in Japan in 1999, emoji were first developed by NTT DoCoMo, followed by DDI Cellular Group (now KDDI) and J-Phone (now SoftBank). Each mobile carrier designed its own set of characters and used their own text encoding extensions, which undermined interoperability. Given the bandwidth and device constraints of the time, encoding emoji was a sensible solution to the alternative of sending actual images, a much more data-intensive proposition. Emoji are digital things. They are unique resources within the particular organizing systems they belong to. The purposes of their organization depend on which of the three levels are being examined.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Standard</h3>
                    <p>
                        The first set of characters explicitly intended as emoji were added to the Unicode Standard in 2009 as part of Version 5.2. In 2010, the Unicode Consortium, which develops and maintains the Unicode Standard, identified a core set of 722 characters from the emoji that had been developed by the Japanese carriers to add to the standard. Of those, 114 were mapped to pre-existing characters and the rest were added as part of Unicode 6.0. What had essentially been created and organized by individuals or informal groups within the Japanese companies, had become the international standard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unicode is a character encoding standard that allows text data--letters and symbols--to be understood across devices. It covers "all the characters for all the writing systems of the world, modern and ancient." Unicode assigns a unique number, called a "code point," to every character covered in the standard. Characters are organized into blocks, which are continuous, non-overlapping ranges of code points. Emoji are included in various blocks of Unicode, such as "Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs" and "Transport and Map Symbols."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Unicode Consortium is a formal group that evaluates both individual characters and scripts (or notations) for inclusion to the Unicode Standard. Characters are the smallest meaningful components of written languages and scripts are collections of letters and other written signs used in one or more writing systems. Examples of scripts encoded into Unicode are Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic. Writing systems provide a set of rules for using scripts to write languages. American English and British English are two examples of different writing systems that use the same script. Characters or scripts are typically added to Unicode if they're already being used extensively in text-based communication. In other words, they are added to the standard if it can be shown that the standard is incomplete without them. The Unicode Consortium oversees resource selection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The demand for new emoji has caused the Unicode Consortium to reconsider inclusion criteria. One such change is adding characters based on logical gaps. For example, if Unicode includes a tiger emoji but not a lion, it would consider adding the latter to the standard. Annex C of the Unicode Technical Report #51, currently in draft form, includes an exhaustive list of the selection factors for emoji. However, the authors state that the factors are not completely determinant.

                    <h3>Organization</h3>
                    <p>
                        The organizing system created for emoji by the Unicode Consortium--this is the standardization level--was initially designed in order to create a new resource collection. Now, the primary goal of the organizing system is to manage the collection. This effort primarily supports the implementation level, which, in turn, enables interaction at the usage level, allowing users to find and send emoji. The Unicode Consortium reviews resources to be added to the collection on a continual basis and has a formal character proposal process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a result of its work, the Unicode Consortium has defined an institutional category for emoji. Categories such as these are created in order "to regulate and systematize activity, to enable information sharing and reuse, and to reduce transaction costs." In addition, they allow the organization to systematically identify characters as emoji. Categories, whether individual, cultural, or institutional, can sometimes influence one another. For example, the institutional categories for emoji created by the Japanese mobile providers defined a new cultural category for its subscribers. Similarly, the Unicode standard, which was shaped by the carriers in Japan, did the same for users internationally.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Implementation</h3>
                    <p>
                        Before users can interact with emoji, developers must implement them. That is, they must create particular instances or expressions of each emoji, which they are free to design. To aid this process, the Unicode Consortium provides design guidelines and examples of emoji, annotations, which are akin to tags, and official names for each emoji, though they "tend to be overly long or confusing" because they were developed as unique identifiers. Once designed, emoji must be organized to facilitate access at the usage level. Developers must organize all of the emoji they decide to support. This organization happens when software is developed. Emoji keyboards typically provide a set of broad categories, such as People or Nature. These are the organizing principles used at the implementation level. Both iOS and Android operating systems include six categories for emoji in their keyboards, which include a Recents panel.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Interpretation</h3>
                    <p>
                        As users begin to learn the categories in which emoji are placed, it starts becoming much more important for them to have individual usage categories. That is, to identify how and when to use emoji. This organization happens on a continual basis and is meant to satisfy requirements based on individuals' preferences and in response to specific situations. These individual categories can influence cultural ones. In some cases, emoji meaning might differ across individuals. In others, an individual might assign multiple meanings to a single emoji. An example of the former is the "open hands sign" emoji, which has been used as a way to convey a dismissive attitude, to communicate "stop" or "back off," or to represent "jazz hands." Examples of the latter, where users often use emoji as double entendres, are the peach and eggplant emoji. Jenna Wortham of the New York Times has said that emoji "have become an ever-evolving cryptographic language that changes depending on who we are talking to, and when."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "This elasticity of meaning is a large part of the appeal and, perhaps, the genius of emoji," writes Adam Sternbergh in an article for New York Magazine. With written communication, it is sometimes difficult to express tone or emotion. Not always because there aren't words to convey them, but because of the relationships, past experiences, and norms between people. Sternbergh writes about a woman he spoke to, for example, who revealed that a recent text from her mother expressing regret, which included a crying-face emoji, was "possibly the most straightforwardly emotional sentiment her mother had ever expressed to her." Phoebe Connelly, writing in an article for the Womanzine special emoji issue, reflected on her use of emoji at the time of her engagement. "Emoji allow me an ironic space within the dreaded cheery sincerity of being engaged. I can emoji diamond rings; therefore, it is ok that yes, I have a diamond ring. I default to emoji, a safe argot, as a means of discussing a marriage I'm emotionally ready for, but still lack the language to describe."
                    </p>
                    <h3>Language</h3>
                    <p>
                        Emoji have transcended the digital environments for which they were created. Emoji Dick, for example, is an emoji translation of Herman Melville's classic, Moby Dick, and is available in both soft and hardcover print editions. The work has even been added to the Library of Congress' collection. While it might be tempting to think about emoji as a language, especially with examples of emoji-only social networks, they lack several features of traditional languages. Emoji lack a generative grammar, which are rules for meaning and for governing the correct ordering of words. Jonnie Robinson, lead curator of sociolinguistics at the British Library, has argued that, at least in its current form, emoji are similar to pidgin languages. In general, pidgins are limited in terms of vocabulary, syntax, and ability to convey register.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether or not emoji evolve into something more is yet to be seen. The Unicode Consortium recommends that future implementations of emoji support embedded graphics. They explain that this approach would allow arbitrary emoji symbols which would no longer be dependent on Unicode encoding. These so called "stickers" are already used on messaging platforms such as WeChat, Viber, and LINE and provide an avenue for monetization, which traditional emoji do not.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>
                        As we've seen, various agents are responsible for creating and maintaining organizing systems for emoji. There are formal groups, such as the Unicode Consortium that define standards that enable classification; device makers and software engineers that implement and organize emoji for consumer use; and, users that develop categories for how to use them. Emoji were encoded as a result of the physical constraints of the time. As those considerations become less relevant and as the character proposal process becomes more of an impediment on the adoption of new emoji, the next iteration of these symbols will materialize. What started in Japan and became an internationalized standard that affected the world, is now starting to move away from the standard that legitimized them.
